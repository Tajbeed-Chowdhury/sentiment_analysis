# Sentiment Analysis 

I will be training a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. Sentiment prediction involves understanding of people feeling about a product or service. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.
